        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>QViz</strong>: A Python app that leverages IBM's Qiskit to
            visualize the Bloch sphere, providing users with an interactive tool
            to explore quantum states and operations. It aims to simplify the
            understanding of quantum computing concepts through dynamic
            visualizations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>EcoTune Amplifier</strong>: This project repurposes old TV
            speakers to create a sustainable speaker system. By modifying and
            enhancing the speaker drivers, the project aims to reduce electronic
            waste while providing an eco-friendly alternative for audio
            amplification.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hospital Bed Management System</strong>: A DBMS-based
            project designed to streamline hospital bed allocation and patient
            management. It tracks bed availability, patient admissions, and
            discharges, ensuring that resources are optimally allocated,
            improving hospital efficiency and patient care.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Socratic Agent</strong>: An AI-powered virtual assistant
            that uses natural language processing (NLP) to engage users in
            Socratic questioning. The agent encourages critical thinking by
            asking thought-provoking questions and guiding users to find their
            own answers, rather than providing direct solutions. It aims to
            enhance learning and problem-solving skills by promoting deeper
            reflection and self-discovery.
